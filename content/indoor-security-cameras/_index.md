## Why Indoor Security Cameras Matter

Indoor security cameras are an essential part of modern home security. They allow you to monitor activity inside your home, keep an eye on children or pets, and provide peace of mind when you’re away. Unlike outdoor cameras, indoor models focus on clarity, motion detection, and smart features rather than weatherproofing.

When selecting an indoor camera, consider factors such as resolution, field of view, two-way audio, night vision, storage options, and integration with smart home devices. Some cameras are wireless for flexible placement, while others are wired or PoE for continuous monitoring.
