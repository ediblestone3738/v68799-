## Why Outdoor Security Cameras Are Important

Outdoor security cameras protect your home, property, and loved ones from intruders. They monitor driveways, entrances, and blind spots while providing real-time alerts. Features like weatherproofing, night vision, motion detection, and smart notifications are essential.

Outdoor cameras can be wired, PoE, or wireless, depending on your home layout and installation preferences. High-end models include AI detection, spotlight alerts, and cloud storage, while budget-friendly options cover basic security needs.
