## Why You Need an Outdoor Security Camera

Outdoor security cameras protect your property from intruders, monitor driveways, and provide peace of mind while you’re away. Look for cameras that are weatherproof, have night vision, motion detection, and smart alerts. The right placement is essential for capturing entrances and blind spots.

Outdoor cameras can be wired, wireless, or PoE. Choosing the correct type depends on your home layout, budget, and installation preferences.
