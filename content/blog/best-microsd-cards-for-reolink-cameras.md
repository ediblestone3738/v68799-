### Overview
When it comes to monitoring your home or business, Reolink security cameras are a popular choice due to their excellent image quality, user-friendly features, and robust performance. However, to maximize their capabilities, especially regarding local storage, choosing the right microSD card is crucial. In this article, we will explore the best microSD cards for Reolink cameras, ensuring you get the most efficient and reliable solution for your surveillance needs.

### Technical Features
Before diving into specific microSD card recommendations, let’s establish what makes a good card for your Reolink camera. Ideally, the best microSD cards for Reolink cameras should include:

- **Storage Capacity**: Reolink cameras typically support microSD cards up to 128GB or even 256GB, allowing for ample video storage. A higher capacity card means longer recording times between overwrites, especially important for continuous recording setups.

- **Speed Class**: Look for cards labeled at least as Class 10, UHS-I (U1), or even U3. A higher speed class ensures that video is recorded smoothly, reducing the risk of frame drops, especially for 4MP or 5MP cameras that generate a lot of data.

- **Durability**: Security cameras are often exposed to different environmental conditions. Choose cards that are waterproof, shockproof, and temperature resistant to ensure reliability over time.

- **Read/Write Speeds**: Look for microSD cards offering high read/write speeds to ensure quick and efficient data transfer and recording. This aspect becomes critical for recording high-resolution videos without lag.

After these considerations, let's delve into some top microSD card options suited for Reolink cameras.

Installing a microSD card in your Reolink camera is a straightforward process, but there are a few tips to ensure smooth operation:
