**Setup & Installation**  
Setting up your Reolink camera to work with NAS storage isn't overly complex, but it does require attention to detail. Here’s a step-by-step guide to get you started:

1. **Preliminary Network Setup**: Before connecting your camera to the NAS, ensure that both devices are connected to the same local network, which may involve connecting the NAS to your router via Ethernet. 

2. **Reolink App Installation**: Download the Reolink app on your smartphone. It’s available on both Android and iOS platforms. Create an account or log in to your existing one.

4. **Configure NAS Storage**: Access your NAS device to set up a shared folder for the Reolink camera. Make sure the folder has writable permissions. The setup varies depending on your NAS brand (Synology, QNAP, etc.). For Synology NAS, you’ll typically go to the File Station to create a shared folder, similar for QNAP.

5. **Connecting Camera to NAS**: Once your shared folder is ready, go back to the Reolink app. Navigate to the Camera Settings -> Advanced Settings -> FTP/SFTP. Enter your NAS IP address, the username, and password to connect. Input the shared folder’s path where you want the recordings to be stored.

6. **Testing the Connection**: To test if everything is working, trigger the motion detection feature and check if the footage appears in the designated NAS folder.
