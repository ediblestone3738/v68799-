## What You Need Before You Start

Before opening the box, it helps to understand what equipment is required to set up the Reolink RLC-810A properly.

### Mandatory Items

To get the camera working, you need:

- Reolink RLC-810A camera
- Ethernet cable (usually included)
- PoE power source (one of the following):
  - A PoE switch
  - A PoE injector
  - A Reolink NVR with PoE ports
- Smartphone (Android or iPhone) or a computer
- Internet router

### Optional but Recommended Items

These make installation easier or more effective:

- Drill and drill bits (for wall mounting)
- Wall plugs and screws (included, but drill may be needed)
- Ladder (for outdoor mounting)
- microSD card (for local recording)
- Weatherproof junction box (for outdoor cable protection)

If you do not yet own a PoE switch or injector, do not worry. This guide explains what they are and how to choose one.

## Understanding Power over Ethernet (PoE) in Simple Terms

The Reolink RLC-810A uses Power over Ethernet, commonly called PoE. This means one Ethernet cable does two jobs at the same time:

- Supplies power to the camera
- Transfers video data to your network

There is no battery and no separate power adapter.

### Your PoE Options Explained

You can power the camera in three main ways:

1. **PoE Switch**  
   A network switch that provides power and data to multiple devices. Best for multi-camera setups.

2. **PoE Injector**  
   A small device that adds power to a single Ethernet cable. Ideal if you only have one camera.

3. **Reolink NVR**  
   A network video recorder with built-in PoE ports. Best if you want continuous recording.

For beginners with one camera, a PoE injector is often the simplest choice.

## Unboxing the Reolink RLC-810A

Open the box carefully and lay out all components.

Inside the box, you should find:

- Reolink RLC-810A camera
- Ethernet cable
- Mounting bracket (usually pre-attached)
- Screws and wall plugs
- Waterproof Ethernet connector
- Quick start guide
- Reset pin

Check that everything is present before continuing.

---

## Step 1: Plan the Camera Location

Before connecting anything, decide where the camera will be installed.

### Choosing the Best Spot

Consider the following:

- Area you want to monitor (driveway, entrance, garden)
- Height of 2.5–3 meters is ideal for outdoor mounting
- Avoid pointing directly into the sun
- Avoid reflective surfaces close to the lens
- Ensure the Ethernet cable can reach your router or PoE device

Take your time here. A well-chosen location improves video quality and detection accuracy.

---

## Step 2: Test the Camera Indoors First (Important)

Before drilling holes or mounting outdoors, always test the camera indoors.

### Why This Step Matters

Testing indoors ensures:

- The camera works correctly
- Your PoE setup is correct
- App setup is successful
- No defective hardware issues

This saves a lot of frustration later.

---

## Step 3: Connect the Camera to Power and Network

### Using a PoE Injector (Beginner-Friendly Method)

1. Plug one Ethernet cable from your router into the injector’s “LAN” port
2. Plug another Ethernet cable from the injector’s “PoE” port into the camera
3. Plug the injector into a wall socket

The camera should power on automatically.

You may see infrared LEDs briefly light up or hear a faint click.

---

## Step 4: Install the Reolink App

### On a Smartphone

1. Open the App Store (iPhone) or Google Play Store (Android)
2. Search for “Reolink”
3. Install the official Reolink app
4. Open the app and create a free Reolink account (recommended)

### On a Computer (Optional)

You can also download Reolink Client software for Windows or macOS from Reolink’s website.

---

## Step 5: Add the Reolink RLC-810A to the App

1. Open the Reolink app
2. Tap “Add Device”
3. Choose “IP Camera”
4. The app should automatically detect the camera on your network
5. Select the camera and follow on-screen instructions

If asked, set:

- A device name (e.g. Front Driveway)
- A strong password (very important)

Once added, you should see live video.

If you see video at this stage, the camera is working correctly.

---

## Step 6: Insert a microSD Card (Optional but Recommended)

If you want local recording without an NVR:

1. Power off the camera
2. Open the SD card slot cover
3. Insert a microSD card (up to 256 GB)
4. Close the cover securely
5. Power the camera back on

In the app:

- Go to camera settings
- Format the SD card
- Enable recording

---

## Step 7: Update Firmware (Recommended)

Updating firmware ensures best performance and security.

1. Open camera settings in the app
2. Go to Device Info or Firmware
3. Check for updates
4. Follow the instructions if an update is available

Do not disconnect power during updates.

---

## Step 8: Mount the Camera Permanently

Once everything works indoors, you can mount the camera.

### Mounting Steps

1. Hold the camera mount against the wall
2. Mark screw holes
3. Drill holes if needed
4. Insert wall plugs
5. Screw the mount securely
6. Attach and angle the camera

Ensure the camera is firmly attached and cannot move easily.

---

## Step 9: Weatherproof the Ethernet Connection

For outdoor installations, this step is crucial.

1. Use the included waterproof Ethernet connector
2. Follow the instructions carefully
3. Ensure all seals are tight
4. Consider using a junction box for extra protection

This prevents water damage and long-term failures.

---

## Step 10: Adjust Camera Angle and Focus

Open the live view in the app while adjusting the camera.

- Aim to cover the desired area
- Avoid unnecessary sky or road coverage
- Tighten the mount screws once satisfied

Small adjustments make a big difference.

---

## Step 11: Configure Motion Detection

This is where many beginners struggle, but it’s manageable.

### Enable Smart Detection

1. Open camera settings
2. Go to Detection Settings
3. Enable Person Detection
4. Enable Vehicle Detection (if applicable)

### Set Detection Zones

1. Draw zones where detection should occur
2. Exclude busy roads, trees, or shadows
3. Adjust sensitivity gradually

Take time here. Proper setup reduces false alerts dramatically.

---

## Step 12: Set Up Notifications

1. Go to Notification Settings
2. Enable push notifications
3. Choose alert types (person, vehicle)
4. Set schedules if needed

Test alerts by walking in front of the camera.

---

## Step 13: Configure Recording Schedule

Choose how the camera records:

- Motion-only recording
- Continuous recording (requires NVR)
- Scheduled recording

For most beginners, motion-based recording works well.

---

## Step 14: Test the Entire System

Before considering setup complete:

- Check live view
- Trigger motion alerts
- Review recorded clips
- Check night vision after dark

Fix issues now rather than later.

---

## Common Beginner Problems and Fixes

### Camera Not Appearing in App

- Check PoE power
- Ensure phone is on same network
- Restart router and camera

### Too Many Alerts

- Lower sensitivity
- Adjust detection zones
- Disable general motion alerts

### Poor Night Image

- Reposition camera
- Avoid reflective surfaces
- Ensure IR LEDs are unobstructed

---

## Final Checks and Long-Term Tips

- Clean the lens occasionally
- Check mounts every few months
- Keep firmware updated
- Back up important footage

---
